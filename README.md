# Seismic Signal Detection and Processing for Space Apps 2024

## Project Overview
This project is designed to detect seismic events and process seismic signals from lunar and Mars data using deep learning models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, and seismic noise tomography. The primary focus is on analyzing seismic signals collected from different sources (e.g., lunar and Mars missions) to classify seismic events and visualize velocity data.

### Key Features:
1. **Data Loading**: Load seismic data from MiniSEED, CSV files, and catalogs.
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply filtering and wavelet denoising to prepare the data.
3. **Neural Network Models**: Build and train models for event classification.
4. **Testing**: Evaluate the models on lunar and Mars seismic test data.
5. **Seismic Noise Tomography**: Analyze velocity data using seismic noise tomography.
6. **Visualization**: Plot seismic signals, spectrograms, and velocity data.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow** (`pip install tensorflow`)
- **Keras** (`pip install keras`)
- **Scikit-learn** (`pip install scikit-learn`)
- **Pandas** (`pip install pandas`)
- **Matplotlib** (`pip install matplotlib`)
- **Obspy** for seismic data processing (`pip install obspy`)

### Step-by-Step Installation:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/space_apps_2024_seismic_detection.git
    cd space_apps_2024_seismic_detection
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure that the necessary data files are present:
    - **`lunar_velocity_data.xlsx`**
    - **`mars_velocity_data.xlsx`**

   Place these files in the appropriate directories (`data/` or adjust paths in the code).

## Usage

### 1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   Data is loaded using `data_loading.py` and preprocessed through `preprocessing.py`. The preprocessing steps include:
   - High-pass filtering
   - Wavelet denoising

   Example usage:
   ```python
   from data_loading import load_seismic_data
   from preprocessing import preprocess_data

   # Load the data (adjust paths)
   seismic_data = load_seismic_data('data/mars/test/data.csv')

   # Preprocess the data
   preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(seismic_data)
   ```

### 2. **Model Training**
   Use `model.py` to build and train the neural network model:
   ```python
   from model import build_model

   # Load training data
   X_train, y_train = ...

   # Build and train the model
   model = build_model(input_shape=(72000, 1))
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2)
   ```

### 3. **Model Testing**
   Test the trained model on lunar and Mars test data using `test_model.py`:
   ```python
   from test_model import test_model_on_data

   # Load the test data
   X_test, y_test = ...

   # Test the model and output results
   test_model_on_data(X_test, y_test, model, 'results/output.csv')
   ```

### 4. **Seismic Noise Tomography**
   Perform seismic noise tomography using the velocity data:
   ```python
   from seismic_noise_tomography import seismic_noise_tomography

   # Run tomography analysis on Mars velocity data
   seismic_noise_tomography('data/mars_velocity_data.xlsx')
   ```

### 5. **Plot Seismic Signals**
   Use `plot_signals.py` to visualize the seismic data and spectrograms:
   ```python
   from plot_signals import plot_signal, plot_spectrogram

   # Plot a signal
   plot_signal(data)

   # Plot spectrogram
   plot_spectrogram(data, sampling_rate)
   ```

### 6. **Workflows**
   Orchestrate full workflows for both lunar and Mars seismic data:
   - **Lunar Workflow**: `lunar_workflow.py`
   - **Mars Workflow**: `mars_workflow.py`

   Example:
   ```python
   from lunar_workflow import lunar_workflow
   from mars_workflow import mars_workflow

   # Run the full workflow for lunar data
   lunar_workflow(lunar_training_data_path, catalog_path, test_data_path, output_path)

   # Run the workflow for Mars data
   mars_workflow(mars_training_data_path, catalog_path, test_data_path, output_path)
   ```

## Results
The results of your model training, testing, and tomography analysis will be stored in the `results/` folder. This folder will contain:
- **Plots**: Visualizations of seismic signals and spectrograms.
- **Model outputs**: CSV files containing model predictions for test data.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Dependencies**: If any Python libraries are missing, ensure that you have installed them using the `pip install` commands provided in the Prerequisites section.
2. **File Not Found Errors**: Ensure that all data files (e.g., `mars_velocity_data.xlsx`, `lunar_velocity_data.xlsx`) are in the correct locations.
3. **Model Not Converging**: If the neural network does not converge during training, consider adjusting the learning rate, batch size, or the number of epochs.

---

## Future Improvements
- Extend the model to handle more seismic events.
- Add additional layers and tuning mechanisms to improve model accuracy.
- Incorporate real-time data feeds for on-the-fly seismic event classification.
